# Spatial information Extraction
This project is to extract spatial information via monocular image.

## Introduce
---
This is Project for 3D reconstruction via monocular image.

According to related work, Depth map estimation based on supervised learning is useful for 3d object detection and segmentation. but it is not sure that a depth map can construct spatial information with actual size. 

so it is a trial to re-construct the 3d model. 



## Update 
----
2023.1, create repo.
